    <h2>Hunter Gottstein</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Hunter. Im twenty, and am currently attenting BYU Pathways in order to obtain a graphic design certificate, with the plan to head up to BYU-I afterwards to persue a graphic design degree.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy video games, drawing, reading, writting, and pretty much just being creative.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church my whole life, and my favorite scripture, funnily enough, has to be 1 Nephi 2:15, I just feels its a wonderful example of humility.</p>
