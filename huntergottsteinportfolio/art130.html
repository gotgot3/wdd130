            <section class="intro">
                <h2>Intro to Graphic Design</h2>
                <p>My Art 130 class is all about learning the basics. Week one we began learning about the principles of design, and each week we circle back to them. We have one pamphlet we fill out each week, workng on learning activities and our current project. Halfway through the week we submit them for our classmates to comment on. At the end of the week we read some chapters in our courses book and take a quiz. Once every four weeks we complete a project, then we get right to work on the next one.</p>

            <section class="poster">
                <h2>The Poster</h2>
                <p>Our first project was to create an abstract nonrepresentational poster for a pre seventy's song that had no lyrics. I chose Stardust by Artie Shaw. I'll admit that the end result wasn't my favorite, I had others I liked better, but we learned on week three that we could only have a certain number of shapes in the piece, which knocked a lot of them out.</p>

                <h2>The Logo</h2>
                <p>Our most recent project was to create a logo for a buisness that we would create. I ended up with an ocean themed bookstore. My original name for it was 20,000 Pages Into The Story, being a play off Twenty-Thousand Leagues Under The Seas, but it ended up being way too long. After four week, my final logo went massive changed the final few days, but I am extreamely happy with the end result.</p>
