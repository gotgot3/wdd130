      <p>
        <b>About Me</b>
        My name is Hunter Gottstein, I am an only child who was born and raised in Arizona. I live in Sahuarita, which is just a little ways south of Tuscon. I am twenty years old, and majoring in Graphic Design. I enjoy programing, I've taken programing courses each semeter, it's just not the kind of think I want to do every day.
        <br>
        <b>Hobbies</b>
        I am a generaly artsy person, hence the graphic design. I spend a good amout of time drawing, reading, writting, painting, and pretty much anything else creative I can do. I enjoy playing a wide variety of video games across all genres, wether sinleplayer of multiplayer. I also heavily enjoy playing Magic: The Gathering.

      <h3>Art 125 Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Art 125: Adobe CC Basics</b>
        One of my two art classes, Art 125 focusus on learning the tools most commonly used in graphic design. Rather than learn about art, we learn how to use Adobe products such as Illustrator, Indesign, and Photoshop. Each week we start off with a small activity where we try something new. Later that week, we do a much larger project using that something new we learned. We follow that up by reading about what we will learn at the start of the next week, letting that information marinate in our heads for the weekend before we recall it on monday.
        <br>
        <b>The Bug</b>
        The bug project is my most recent project in art 125. We just spent the week learning about using the pen tool and bezier curves, so are assignment was to find a bug and use that newfound knowlage to draw it. After searching for the right one, I found a yellow ladybug that I wanted to create, and while I don't think I did the best job at making it look like a lady bug, I did make a good looking beatle.
        <br>
        <b>The Collage</b>
        About four weeks in, we had the collage project. The assignment was to take eight photos and edit them in photoshop to make a sinle image. One of the first images I found was the guy painting, and I just knew what I was going to make. My biggest struggle whith this was finding a table, because the photo of the man was only waist up. In the end I settled for the best I could find and got Photoshop to create the rest of the table, which didn't end up quite right, but it was the best I had.
        <br>
        <b>The Map</b>
        My map project was my midterm project. We were assigned to make a map of BYU-I, adding pictures and text along the way. I opted for a pamphlet style, and I like how it turned out.
        <br>
        <b>Pixabay</b>
        One of the first projects we had was to make a Pixabay page. We had too find our own images and create our own symbols. Some definitely turned out better than others, but it was a learning experience. It was pretty basic compared to the rest of the semester, and I know now how I could do it better, easier, and faster.

      <h3>Art 130 Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Art 130: Intro to Graphic Design</b>
        My Art 130 class is all about learning the basics. Week one we began learning about the principles of design, and each week we circle back to them. We have one pamphlet we fill out each week, workng on learning activities and our current project. Halfway through the week we submit them for our classmates to comment on. At the end of the week we read some chapters in our courses book and take a quiz. Once every our weeks we complete a project, then we get right to work on the next one.
        <br>
        <b>The Poster</b>
        Our first project was to create an abstract nonrepresentational poster for a pre seventy's song that had no lyrics. I chose Stardust by Artie Shaw. I'll admit that the end result wasn't my favorite, I had others I liked better, but we learned on week three that we could only have a certain number of shapes in the piece, which knocked a lot of them out.
        <br>
        <b>The Logo</b>
        Our most recent project was to create a logo for a buisness that we would create. I ended up with an ocean themed bookstore. My original name for it was 20,000 Pages Into The Story, being a play off Twenty-Thousand Leagues Under The Seas, but it ended up being way too long. After four week, my final logo went massive changed the final few days, but I am extreamely happy with the end result.
